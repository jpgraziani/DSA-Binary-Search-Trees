```binary search tree
Each tree then can be composed of many subtrees. Each node in a tree is the root of a subtree beginning at that node. Nesting trees in this manner can be achieved using recursion.
```

```binary search tree
Definition of recursion, it generally involves solving a problem in terms of similar subproblems and a base case.
